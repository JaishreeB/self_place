Self-Awareness - foundation of learning agility, as it involves understanding one's strengths, weaknesses, values, and motivations.
ability to understand yourself

--------------"begin with the end in mind"


fixed mindset and growth mindset

Let's consider two students, Meera and Arjun, to illustrate the impact of these mindsets on learning mathematics.

fixed - 
Meera struggles with algebra and believes that her math abilities are fixed. When faced with a difficult algebra problem, she thinks, "I'm just not good at math. I'll never understand this." Because of this belief, Meera avoids practicing algebra problems and doesn't seek help, leading to poor performance in math class.

growth
On the other hand, Arjun also finds algebra challenging but has a growth mindset. When he encounters a difficult problem, he thinks, "This problem is challenging, but I can improve if I keep practicing and ask for help." Arjun seeks help from the teacher, practices algebra problems regularly, and uses online resources to understand the concepts better. Over time, Arjun's math skills improve, and he becomes more confident in his ability to tackle challenging problems.
